# Turbo C++ Repository

An exploration of C++ for MS DOS

## What is this?

I was born in the mid 90's, when machines were advanced enough to have Graphic User Interfaces and accessability pieces standard. Yet my family was very old school. My introduction to computers was through my Grandfather's 286 running MS DOS 2 that he salvaged from a trash can somewhere. The blinking curser after the `C:\>` always felt like home.

I began my journey into Software after being inspired by multiple sources, but the greatest push came from the works of Richard Garriott and his Ultima series. Seeing the power a passionate developer can put into a project with little to no development tools in existence pushed me to understand what it was like in that world, to build without assistance of the tools the developers of today take for granted. I'm realizing I've talked for two paragraphs without actually getting into the meat of this yet. Let me fix that...

This is the extension of the original C learning experience I began in the [TurboC Repositor](https://github.com/MGreco2112/TurboC) prior to determining that my desired goals would be better suited within the C++ language.

This Repository will highlight my projects built with [Turbo C++ found on DosHAVEN](http://www.doshaven.eu/programming-tools/) inside of [DosBox](https://www.dosbox.com/), at least until I can get ahold of vintage hardware. These projects will begin with work done through vintage textbooks and manuals, and will branch out to my own projects as I become more accustomed to working within the Turbo C++ IDE and understand the C++ language better. As with all my steps in my programming journey, I will celebrate the small victories and work my way up to the large ones.

The dream will be to create fully functional, engaging, and entertaining applications for antiquated hardware. This is the dream that I set out to accomplish in early 2019 and is now taking shape. With my determination, drive, and the love that I have for growing this skill set, I should look back on this repository in the future and smile at how far I've come since penning this readme file.
